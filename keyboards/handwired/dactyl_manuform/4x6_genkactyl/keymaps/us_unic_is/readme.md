# US layout with unicode-based Icelandic

This keyboard is meant to be used with the MacOS Unicode Hex Input source.

The idea was to use the US keyboard layout as a base, but change a few inputs to Icelandic characters, sent using the unicode support in QMK.

While prototyping this setup I discovered that iTerm2 simply hates the Unicode Hex Input. It doesn't interpret the unicode keys as anything except perhaps exiting insert mode and going into normal mode in the vi-emulation in Zsh.

I've switched to Kitty as a result, which I've been thinking about doing anyway.
