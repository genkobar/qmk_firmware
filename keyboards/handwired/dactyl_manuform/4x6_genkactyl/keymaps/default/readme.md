# Default 4x6 Genkactyl Layout

This is the default layout on the 4x6 Genkactyl. The base layer is Qwerty and relatively basic, except that all instances of the Ctrl key are actually Ctrl-Escape, where it functions as Escape when tapped but Control when held.

### Number & Symbol Layer

To access numbers, hold the NUMSYM-layer key in the bottom left of the left thumb cluster. The numbers are laid out like a keypad on the right side, while symbols are on the left side. 

Various other functionality has been added to this layer to avoid having too many layers.

### OS Functions Layer 

This is sort of the catch-all layer for remaining stuff. Here we have the arrow keys positioned where they are in Vim, volume and media controls, F1 - F12 keys and also mouse movement keys.
 
#### Handy Browser Tab Switching

The OSFunc layer also has dedicated keys that send command-alt-left and command-alt-right, which are the shortcuts used to switch tabs in the Firefox browser.

### Halmak Layer
I decided to try learning the Halmak layout, so it's available as the second layer. You can toggle it on and off via the OSFUNC layer. 

Since this layer doesn't change the keys that the Icelandic-only keys are on, they will remain in the same place on both Qwerty and Halmak.
